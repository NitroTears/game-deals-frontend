## Gamedeals.com.au Frontend Project

This is a personal project I am undertaking in my spare time, to create a new frontend and MVC structure using Laravel, React and Chakra UI.

I really like the site, I use it a ton. So I decided to take up this project both for a learning experience and for fun :)

Some packages I have used in this project include:

- **Javascript**
  - react-table (7.8.0)
  - chakra-ui/react (1.8.8)
  - chakra-ui/icons (1.8.7)
- **PHP**
  - laravel-framework (9.2)
    - requires PHP 8.0.2 or higher
